    Imagine that I will host a  party and that I'm developing a web application that allows my
    invitees to electronically RSVP. there are some four key features:
    <br />Web header and footer included:<br />
    A home page that shows information about the party with some beautiful pictures<br />
    A form that can be used to RSVP<br />
    Validation for the RSVP form, which will display a thank-you page<br />
    RSVPs e-mailed to the party host when complete <br />
    CRUD function for the food menu and invitee lists<br />
   SQL Database manipulate the information of the invitees and food memu provided for the party<br />
